## Story points that I would like to hit

    - Nova ends up in M31
    - 12 Leaders are faced with hard sitution of how to continue
    - bumpy but successful seeds are planted 
    - The grip of the Unions "norms" are loosened 
    - Cultures split into ways of living which were previously blocked 
    - These cultures have tension , war, trade, history
    - 

#### What the fuck to do now

    Situation
        - 102,510 crew, roughly 50/50 male female
        - The mean age of the crew 35.
        - The union has been around for thousands of years with the phylosphi of keeping the human condition untouched past debilating deases 
        - Nova estimates that if natural copulation was to be allow the crew would be down to zero within five generations
        - with assigned breeding, selected for varience and health, 7-8 generations 
        - A natural path for the Novas continuation is doomed

    Options 
        - Brake from the Unions conventions
            # Bio options 
                - Cloning
                - Life extension
                - Gentic alterations , simple to the extreem
                - birthing tanks
            # Tech options
                - Mind uploading + freezing tissues
                - Syntytic enhasments 
                - AIG unblocked
        - Keep to the unions conventions
            # 40 to 60 years to build  
            - Try and build another deepgate to get back
            - Establish a second union here 

#### The following

    - A religious take up reveals itself in the ships less scientific sections (Military, Support Staff, Mining)
    - Old tests of prowess are taken back up, fighters scar themselves before a fight to level the playing feild, the victor is seen as an indication of the divine will 
    - A new leader is brough""t to the forefront
    - the cult is violent and the leader is replacible 

#### Visions

    - Samantha Ki is plagued with visions

#### Military might is right

    - We have mulitpile leaders in this space, they are power hungry and will want to play the polictics game for control
    - Janeway will want to keep on top of this,  TODO introduce a second to Janeway
