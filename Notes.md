## Story points that I would like to hit

    - Nova ends up in M31
    - 12 Leaders are faced with a hard situation of how to continue
        -> Janeway decides to keep the majority of the crew in status until they reach a planet
        -> This takes about 6 months to get to a promising cluster of planets 
        -> Meanwhile the ousted military leaders aren't happy, with the lack of vision
        -> One or a few of them stage a cue 
        -> A new unwelcomed leader is placed at the head
    - bumpy but successful seeds are planted 
        -> A colony is established and faces hard times, classes emerge 
        -> scientific endeavor and mining are the lower classes
        -> Several small escape plans are made, lead by Samantha Ki, and scatter all at once through out the system
        -> The New Union double downs on the remaining lower class, while seeds of new edge clusters spring up in remote parts of the local system
    - Cultures split into ways of living which were previously blocked 
    - These cultures have tension , war, trade, history
    - 

#### What the fuck to do now

    Situation
        - 102,510 crew, roughly 50/50 male female
        - The mean age of the crew 35.
        - The union has been around for thousands of years with the philosophy of keeping the human condition untouched past debilitating disease 
        - Nova estimates that if natural copulation was to be allow the crew would be down to zero within five generations
        - with assigned breeding, selected for variance and health, 7-8 generations 
        - A natural path for the Novas continuation is doomed

    Options 
        - Brake from the Unions conventions
            # Bio options 
                - Cloning
                - Life extension
                - Genetic alterations , simple to the extreme
                - birthing tanks
            # Tech options
                - Mind uploading + freezing tissues
                - Synthetic enhancements 
                - AIG unblocked
        - Keep to the unions conventions
            # 40 to 60 years to build  
            - Try and build another DeepGate to get back
            - Establish a second union here 

#### The following

    - A religious take up reveals itself in the ships less scientific sections (Military, Support Staff, Mining)
    - Old tests of prowess are taken back up, fighters scar themselves before a fight to level the playing field, the victor is seen as an indication of the divine will 
    - A new leader is brought to the forefront
    - the cult is violent and the leader is replaceable 

#### Visions

    - Samantha Ki is plagued with visions

#### Military might is right

    - We have multiple leaders in this space, they are power hungry and will want to play the politics game for control
    - Janeway will want to keep on top of this,  TODO introduce a second to Janeway
